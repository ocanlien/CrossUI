If you are a fan of Pro Evolution Soccer 2013, you might have encountered a frustrating error message when trying to launch the game: "The dynamic library rld.dll failed to initialize (e5)". This error prevents you from playing the game and can be caused by various reasons, such as corrupted or missing rld.dll file, antivirus interference, incompatible system settings, or outdated drivers. In this article, we will show you some possible solutions to fix this error and enjoy your game.
 
## Solution 1: Download and Replace rld.dll File
 
One of the most common causes of this error is a missing or corrupted rld.dll file, which is a dynamic link library that contains the game's rendering functions. To fix this, you can try to download a new rld.dll file from a reliable source and replace it in your game folder. Here are the steps:
 
**Download Zip ★★★★★ [https://t.co/lxk3GRJLKf](https://t.co/lxk3GRJLKf)**

2. Extract the downloaded file and copy the rld.dll file to your clipboard.
3. Navigate to your game installation folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2013.

5. Launch the game and see if the error is gone.

## Solution 2: Disable or Whitelist Your Antivirus
 
Another possible cause of this error is your antivirus software blocking or deleting the rld.dll file as a false positive. To fix this, you can try to disable your antivirus temporarily or whitelist the game folder in your antivirus settings. Here are the steps:

1. Open your antivirus software and look for an option to disable it temporarily. Alternatively, you can right-click on its icon in the system tray and select Disable or Exit.
