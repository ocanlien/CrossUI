One of the advantages of Shiva 3d Game Engine 1.9.1.0 is that it supports Collada model files, which are a standard format for exchanging 3D assets between different applications. Collada files can contain geometry, materials, textures, animations, and other information about a 3D model. You can use various 3D modeling tools, such as Blender, Maya, or 3ds Max, to create and export Collada files for your game. Shiva can import Collada files directly into the Data Explorer and use them in your scenes.
 
In this tutorial series, we will use Collada files for the main characters of our game: a spaceship and an asteroid.
